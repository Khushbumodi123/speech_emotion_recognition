Speech Emotion Recognition

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion from their speech or voice. This is due to the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. SER has received increasing interest all through current years and is used in audio surveillance, web-based E-learning, commercial applications, clinical studies, etc. A teacher can use SER to decide what subjects can be taught and in turn, will be able to develop strategies for managing emotions within the learning environment. That is why the learnerâ€™s emotional state should be considered in the classroom. In the speech emotion recognition study, the most important issue is the effective parallel use of the extraction of proper speech features and an appropriate classification engine. We will in our current work build a model using a classifier that will be able to recognize and classify emotion from sound files. We will initialize the classifier and train the model and finally calculate the accuracy of our model.
